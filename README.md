# ðŸ“„ Artificial Intelligence 

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence** repository!  
This collection of Python programs demonstrates core AI concepts and techniques through simple and practical implementations.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

- **BFS.py**  
  Implements the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm to explore nodes in a graph or tree level by level. Ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

- **DFS.py**  
  Implements the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm, exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Useful for scenarios like maze solving.

- **NLTK.py**  
  A basic demonstration of **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**, showing how to perform simple text processing tasks like tokenization, stemming, and frequency analysis.

- **Queens Problem.py**  
  Solves the classic **N-Queens Problem** using a backtracking approach, placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

- Hands-on experience with fundamental AI search techniques.
- Introduction to natural language processing (NLP) basics using NLTK.
- Problem-solving skills using recursion and backtracking strategies.
